# FocusTimer
(In progress) A work timer app to help you track time spent on a task, similar to a pomodoro timer.

## Purpose
The goal is to make a work timer app that allows the user to get into the "zone" by avoiding unnecessary distractions.
If the user focuses on the timer app itself rather than their task, then the timer app has failed to do its job.

Distractions in a work timer app appear in a couple of ways:
1) UI is distracting because it has too many buttons or other prompts in view.
2) Confusing navigation scheme. Not intuitive on how to set times, pause or abort timer.
3) "Required" interactions with the app, e.g. starting a break or next session.
